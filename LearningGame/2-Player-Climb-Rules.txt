2 Player Climb

	This is a two player version of my card game Climb. The objective is to "climb" through
	your opponent's deck and empty their deck faster than yours.


Deck:
	-Deck is split between black and red decks. 

Card Values:
	-All numeric cards (2-10) are worth their values
	-Royalty cards (King, Queen, Jack) are all valued at 10
	-Royalty cards have seniority over each other
		-Kings beats a Queen and Jack and 10, a Queen beats a Jack and 10, and a Jack beats a 10.
	-Ace counts for 11

Starting the game:
	-Black and Red decks are shuffled and one King from each deck is pulled out.
		-Doesn't matter which king
	-Three cards are drawn to each respective player from their deck and placed down.
		-All cards in play are visible to both players.
	-Coin flip (50/50 rand()) for turn.
	
Player Turn:
	-On player turn, the player can use any combination (mathematically and numerically) 
	of the cards in their hand to "attack" any combination of cards in the opponent's deck. 
		-For example, I can play the 2 and the 6 in my hand to beat my opponent's 8. 
		-Players can only move once per turn
	-After a player has played their turn, a "draw" period commences, where the playing field
		is refilled to three cards of each color.
	-After the draw period, the turn alternates to the opponent. 
	
Winning the game:
	-A player wins when he or she empties the deck of their opponent.
	-Score is calculated based on the remaining cards the winner has not played.

Ties:
	-A player can also choose to match up against their opponent with the same numerical value
		of cards. When this happens, the top card of each deck is pulled on top of that combination,
		and the higher card wins. 
		-If there is a tie again, keep going until there is not.

Extra Notes For Clarification:
	-Legal Combinations:
		-A Queen and a Jack would beat two Jacks.
	-Ace does not have seniority over royal cards and royal cards do not have seniority over
		the Ace.
	-If a player attacks a King with their King, no tie period commences, both cards are discarded.
	-If a tie happens and one or both teams does not have enough cards to play the tie, both cards
		are discarded and a tie period does not commence.
	-If the game ends and all cards from both deck have been discarded, meaning
		only the two final kings are left, the game ends in a TIE. 
	-You can play all your cards at once if you choose to.
		-For example, if you had 2 - 2 - 4 you could play all three of those to beat a single 7
		or tie an 8 etc.
	

**unfinished but this is the groundwork just gotta throw more rules in to account for special cases**
